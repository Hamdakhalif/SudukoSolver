This Python code initializes a Sudoku grid and uses the Pygame library to create a graphical user interface (GUI) for solving Sudoku puzzles. The GUI displays the grid, and a backtracking algorithm is implemented to solve the puzzle step by step, updating the GUI after each move. The visualization includes a slight delay between each step for clarity. The program responds to user interaction, allowing the reset of the grid with the spacebar, initiating the solving process for a new puzzle. The backtracking algorithm systematically fills empty cells with numbers from 1 to 9, checking for the validity of each move in the rows, columns, and 3x3 subgrids. If a number is found to be invalid, the algorithm backtracks and explores alternative solutions until a valid solution for the entire puzzle is achieved. The Pygame display serves as an interactive tool to observe and understand the backtracking process in solving Sudoku puzzles.
